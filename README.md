### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - I will use correct HTML structure. There will be four main HTML pages. One for login, one for a home screen (this will show books read, wishlist of books, and friends), one for a read book screen (this will show the book title, an image if applicable, the review, and an option to share it with a friend), and one for books not read (this will allow you to add a book to your wishlist or mark that you've read it).
- **CSS** - I will use CSS to create an aesthetically pleasing style. I will also use it to create website that is easy to navigate and feels natural
- **React** - I will use React to allow the user to login, add books, search for a friend, and comment on books.
- **Service** - I will use Service for backend service with end points for the login and add books/photos using Open Library API
- **DB/Login** - I will use DB/Login to store user info, book database, wishlist, read book list, and friend list.
- **WebSocket** - Book comments, book additions, and friend additions occur in real time and can be seen immediately after it is finished.
