It is surprisingly easy to get a domain name and connect it to your IP address!

## Caddy

No problem. Worked just like it said in the instructions.

## HTML

I made sure I used the right structural elements for my website. I used the example from the github notes to help me keep my structure more organized too. Being Organized in your HTML code is super important so you don't get lost in your tags.

## CSS

This took a couple hours to get it how I wanted. I had a hard time working with bootstrap and I felt like I had to fight it a lot. Maybe I did it wrong, but I got my website styled.

## React Part 1: Routing

The code is structured much better and I like the organization. It was a pretty smooth process converting to React. I had to fix a few styling errors and structure, but nothing major

## React Part 2: Reactivity

There is so much to learn and so much you can do with reactivity. I found just looking at what is possivble is really helpful. This was pretty difficult to learn everything I needed to do, but it was rewarding to see the finished product.

## Web Service

There is a lot going on when it comes to webservice and it was overwhelming at first.

## Mongo DB

This was way easier to implement than I thought. I had my code set up nicely so there were only a few lines that needed to change after adding my database files and making sure I installed everything and made my mongo account.
